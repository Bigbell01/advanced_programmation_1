-The first file (bart-sdl-engine-e17) is the base engin my teacher gave me to do my project. I did not write all this code but it is needed to start my project.

-The second file (Gradius_project) I did it all on my own except for Barbe.cpp and barbe.h, I wrote all this code by myself.

-In the third file there is parts of a team project. I made TMNTInTime.cpp and TMNTInTime.H and i did the code for the mouvement and input management in 
 PlayerAnimation.cpp(line 31 to 131) a fellow student did the animation parts(that wasn't my assigment).For the complete project, you will have to ask me.
